# Golden Buddies: MERN Stack Single-Page Application

Screenshot of project:

## Description

Welcome to Golden Buddies, our full stack MERN application focused on Golden Retrievers and their buddies! This project aims to solve a real-world challenge, Golden Retrievers that want to communicate via social media, by working with real-world data, focusing on data management and user demand. We have used various technologies, tools, and best practices to create a polished and interactive application that showcases our problem-solving skills.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: We have utilized React to build the frontend of our application. React allows us to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the state of the application.

- **Backend**: For the backend, we chose GraphQL with Node.js and Express.js. GraphQL provides a flexible and efficient way to handle data queries and mutations, while Node.js and Express.js offer a robust server environment.

- **Database**: We implemented MongoDB, a NoSQL database, using the Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. This combination allows for seamless data management.

- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Heroku, providing a live version accessible to users.

- **Authentication**: Our application includes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication, ensuring secure user sessions.

- **Payment Integration**: We considered the Stripe payment platform, allowing the application to accept charitable donations.

## Features

- Retrieve, add, update, and delete data using GraphQL queries and mutations.
- Polished and mobile-friendly UI.
